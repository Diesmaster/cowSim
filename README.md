# cowSim
to install:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

to run:
python3 sim.py run cow_sim 16 -v
python3 sim.py var_analysis cow_sim 3 50 200 1 10 [] -v


this is an example, the sim software is not fully ready right now as a comand line tool, so if you want to use the other options of the tool you will have to change the code.
